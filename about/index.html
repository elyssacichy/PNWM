            We've used George exclusively for more than 10 years for gutter, windows and screen cleaning and deck powerwash. He's professional, reliable, we'll priced, cleans up after the job and does excellent work always. Highly recommend him. Prompt response time too which I really appreciate.

            George has been doing our windows twice a year for a very long time. He does great work, does it quickly, and goes the extra mile to accommodate us, such as when I forget to take down a screen or move a piece of furniture. George is one of those individuals that you can invite into your home without a worry. Very trustworthy. He is more of a family member or friend rather than a service provider. We highly recommend him.
