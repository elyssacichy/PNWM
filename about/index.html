            Dear George:
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you so much for taking such good care of my home! My windows are clean and bright... It's nice to have someone I can trust to take the same care of my home that I have over the years... P.S.:I've also really relied on you to take great care of my clients whose homes were coming on the market. Clean, sparkling windows and properly-working gutters definitely help homes sell, and that's how you leave them. Thanks again!
